# Project Title

Module 3 Challenge

## Description

This is the third project in the University of Texas
at Austin Coding Bootcamp.  In this project, students have been
tasked with modifying code to create a password generator. The
password generator prompts users to select the number of characters
in the password (from 8 - 128), and then whether or not the password
should have lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or
special characters.
The code then generates the password and displays it on the screen.
